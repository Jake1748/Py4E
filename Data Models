Data models are a representation of data for a data schema
It is essentially a web diagram of how all the information in a database is related to each other
The web structure is necessary to replace the string lengths of the inputed data to integers
This reduces the amount of scanning the computers perform and leads to faster processing.
The primary key is the identifier that relates data in its native table
Foreign keys are essentially the identifiers of a row in a different table
Both primary and foreign keys are usually numbers
